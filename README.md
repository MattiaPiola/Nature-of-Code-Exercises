# Nature-of-Code-Exercises
A collection of exercises from Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code. Written in python.

# The Book
Nature of Code is a book from Daniel Shiffman. In the book, the author tries to recreate natural phenomena and the stocastic yet "organic" nature of such phenomena with Processing.
You can buy the book here: [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/). 

The book is also freely available on the web [HERE](http://natureofcode.com/book/).

You can also follow the author's channel on youtube: [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

# Why are you using Python instead of Processing?
I'm following the book as an exercise for my programming skills in general, and being Python my first language, I'm trying to use it as much as possible. While Python in general, and PyGame in particular, aren't particularly suited for the kind of stuff contained in the book, I think the extra effort necessary to translate those ideas in this language will help me develop my skills.
Code won't be as nice to see as Shiffman's, but the important thing is to get the work done ;)

# Can I contribute?
I'm trying to use this repo as a collection of my personal efforts, so, while you're free to open issues and comment my code (please do!), I won't accept any pull request.
